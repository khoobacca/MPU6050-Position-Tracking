# MPU6050-Position-Tracking

Hey, its been a while...

I got a job, built more things, learned even more.

The things i wanna build right now is:

1. a network for Canadian engineers interested in aerospace.
2. a drone

since number 1 is more straight forwards than 2, heres more of it: I eventually want to create my own company around a drone - specifically for surveillance and defense.

Im beginning with finding out how an FC works and how CV works as well. Heres my attempt to creat a basic position tracking system using a IMU - an inertial measurement unit. fancy for an accelerometer and a gyroscope.
This basically tracks everything about position. this is required in an FC - flight controller - because it basically tells the drone where is is and what tell its motors to stay up in the air.

its all about balance.

i hope to find some help with this when I actually make my company but im just doing everything myself for the time being.
